# Duber-Eatz

Duber wants to get involved in his family's business, so he starts a delivery service for his family's famous burger restaurant. A map of the delivery area is 
loaded from a .txt file, with the file name in the format testcase[number].txt. The first two lines of the file are a number that 
represents the number of rows and columns, respectively. The rest of the lines are the map with three legends: '#' represents a wall, 'S' represents the starting position,
a number from '1' to '9' represents the delivery position, and the tip is calculated using the number with the equation (tip_number - time_to_position) * 10.

The program finds the best route to maximize the tip.

The final map along with the route taken will be displayed in console, with the path taken marked in 'x' and a destination marked in 'X'. The program also generates a 
file in .ppm format to help visualize the map.

This program focuses on file I/O in java and the usage of recursion.
